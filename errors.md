  # Quality Review: src/sheet/schema.js
  
  ISSUE FOUND - CRITICAL BUG: The export status validation has a fundamental flaw.

  Problem: Line 203 filters out null values from the validation list, but line 204 allows
  invalid values. In Google Sheets, when setAllowInvalid(true) is used with a value list, it
  only allows values from the list OR completely invalid entries - it doesn't allow null as
  intended.

  Result: Tasks with null export status will show as invalid/error in the sheet, breaking the
   user experience.

  Fix Required: The validation logic should either:
  1. Include null in the validation list, or
  2. Use a different validation approach for nullable enum fields

# Quality Review: src/ui/settings.js - configureStagingFolder()

  ISSUE FOUND - LOGIC BUG: Line 53 has a critical flaw in the write access test.

  Problem: The code calls DriveApp.getFolderById(testFolder.getId()).setTrashed(true) instead
   of directly using testFolder.setTrashed(true). This creates an unnecessary extra API call
  and potential race condition.

  Additional Issues:
  1. Missing error handling: If the info() function (line 65) fails, it could crash the
  entire configuration process
  2. URL regex limitation: The regex (/folders\/([a-zA-Z0-9-_]+)/) doesn't account for all
  valid Google Drive folder ID characters
  3. No cleanup guarantee: If setTrashed() fails, the test folder remains in the staging
  directory

  Functionality Assessment: Will partially work but has reliability issues that could cause
  intermittent failures.

# Quality Review: src/ui/menu.js - Menu Functions

  CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND - LOGIC ERROR: Lines 302-313 contain a fundamental mismatch in
  expected return format.

  Problem:
  - Line 302 calls generateExportStatusReport() and expects reportResult.success and
  reportResult.error (lines 304, 307)
  - But line 313 accesses reportResult.report, suggesting the function returns {success: 
  true, report: {...}}
  - This is inconsistent - if there's a .report property, the success check should be on the
  outer object

  Additional Issues:
  1. Null reference risk: Line 313 const report = reportResult.report; could fail if
  reportResult doesn't have a .report property
  2. Unsafe property access: Lines 320, 325, etc. access nested properties without null
  checks (e.g., report.systemHealth.score)
  3. Unicode in Google Apps Script: Emoji characters (üè•, üìä, etc.) may not render properly
  in Google Sheets UI alerts

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail at runtime due to the logic error in report result
  handling.

  #‚è∫ Quality Review: src/sheet/queries.js - Enhanced Query Functions

  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Date Handling Bug (Lines 182-184)

  Problem: The date comparison logic is inverted. The code finds the earliest date instead of
   the latest.
  new Date(exportTime) < new Date(batches[batchId].createdDate)
  Should be > to find the most recent date for "created date".

  Issue 2: Logical Contradiction (Lines 81-96)

  Problem: Lines 83-85 check for EXPORT_STATUS_VALUES.STAGED to exclude already exported
  tasks, but staged tasks are NOT exported yet - they're ready for delivery. This will
  incorrectly exclude valid tasks.

  Issue 3: Missing Function Dependency

  Problem: Line 178 calls formatTaskResponse() but this function is not defined in the
  current file, suggesting a missing import/dependency.

  Issue 4: Review Status Logic Flaw (Lines 39-58)

  Problem: Complex nested conditionals with overlapping logic paths that could allow tasks
  through that should be filtered out.

  Functionality Assessment: Will produce incorrect results due to the date logic bug and
  staged status filtering error.

# Quality Review: src/export/staging.js - Core Staging Functions

  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Field Mapping Bug (Lines 371-378)

  Problem: The camelCase to UPPER_SNAKE_CASE conversion is flawed:
  const columnKey = field.replace(/([A-Z])/g, '_$1').toUpperCase();
  This converts taskId to TASK_ID correctly, but productionFolderLink becomes
  PRODUCTION_FOLDER_LINK when the schema uses PRODUCTION_FOLDER_LINK. The leading underscore
  issue could cause mismatches.

  Issue 2: Missing Function Dependencies

  Problems:
  - Line 249: updateTaskRecord() - not defined in this file
  - Line 278: createFolder() - not defined in this file
  - Line 282: listFiles() - not defined in this file
  - Line 290: copyFile() - not defined in this file
  - Line 157: extractFileIdFromUrl() - not defined in this file

  Issue 3: Transaction Inconsistency (Lines 247-258)

  Problem: If updateTaskRecord() fails but the file staging succeeded, the task will be in an
   inconsistent state - files staged but status not updated. No rollback mechanism.

  Issue 4: Export Sheet Column Mismatch Risk (Lines 368-385)

  Problem: The dynamic field mapping relies on exact camelCase-to-SNAKE_CASE conversion
  matching the schema, but field names in task objects may not perfectly align with schema
  column names.

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail at runtime due to missing function dependencies and may
   produce inconsistent data due to transaction issues.

# Quality Review: src/export/validation.js - File Validation Logic

  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Case-Sensitive File Matching Bug (Lines 80, 85, 90)

  Problem: The logic compares fileName.endsWith('.obj') (lowercase) but then checks
  originalName.includes(folderName) (original case). This creates inconsistency:
  - If a file is named Task_123.OBJ (uppercase extension), it won't match .obj
  - If folderName is case-sensitive, the inclusion check might fail

  Issue 2: Missing Function Dependencies

  Problems:
  - Line 36: listFiles() - not defined in this file
  - Line 236: listFolders() - not defined in this file
  - Line 249: listFiles() - not defined in this file

  Issue 3: Logic Flaw in File Categorization (Lines 84-87)

  Problem: Production images are identified as .jpg files containing the folder name, but
  this will incorrectly exclude files like task_123_alignment.jpg if the folder name is
  task_456 (different task). The logic should be more specific.

  Issue 4: Validation Accuracy Issue (Lines 253-257)

  Problem: The validation only checks file count but not file types. A task could have 6
  random files and pass validation, even if it's missing critical .obj or .mp4 files.

  Functionality Assessment: Will produce false positives and false negatives due to case
  sensitivity bugs and insufficient validation depth.


# Quality Review: src/export/stagingHandlers.js - Staging Wizard Handlers

  ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Missing Error Type Import (Line 71)

  Problem: Code references ValidationError but this class is not imported or defined in this
  file. This will cause a runtime error.

  Issue 2: Function Dependency Chain Issues

  Problems:
  - Line 79: getStagingConfiguration() - appears to be from staging.js
  - Line 91: executeStagingOperation() - appears to be from staging.js
  - Line 145: getExportFilterOptions() - appears to be from filters.js

  These dependencies may work if all files are loaded globally, but there's no explicit
  indication of the load order.

  Issue 3: Error Handling Inconsistency (Lines 119-135)

  Problem: The error handler references selection.tasks.length after a potential selection
  validation error, which could cause secondary errors if selection is null/undefined.

  Issue 4: Array Safety Issue (Lines 106-114)

  Problem: The code assumes stagingResult.validationFailures and
  stagingResult.stagingFailures are arrays, but doesn't validate this. If they're undefined,
  the spread operator will fail.

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail at runtime due to missing ValidationError import, and
  has potential null reference issues.

# Quality Review: src/export/delivery.js - Core Delivery Functions

  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Missing Function Dependencies (Multiple lines)

  Problems: The following functions are called but not defined in this file:
  - Line 22: getTasksByExportStatus()
  - Line 41: findStagingBatchFolder() (defined later but called before)
  - Line 48: createDeliveryFolder() (defined later but called before)
  - Line 51: copyTaskFoldersToClient() (defined later but called before)
  - Line 58: validateAndUpdateDeliveredTasks() (not defined anywhere)
  - Line 130: listFolders()
  - Line 163: createFolder()

  Issue 2: Function Definition Order Bug (Lines 41, 48, 51)

  Problem: Functions are called before they're defined:
  - findStagingBatchFolder() called on line 41, defined on line 122
  - createDeliveryFolder() called on line 48, defined on line 159
  - copyTaskFoldersToClient() called on line 51, defined on line 173

  In JavaScript, function declarations are hoisted, but these look like they might be
  function expressions based on context.

  Issue 3: Folder Search Logic Flaw (Lines 132-140)

  Problem: The folder name search uses .includes(exportBatchId) which is too broad. A batch
  ID of "123" would match folders named "Export_2024-01-01_1234" incorrectly.

  Issue 4: Incomplete Function (Line 173+)

  Problem: The copyTaskFoldersToClient() function is cut off and appears incomplete. This
  will cause runtime errors.

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail immediately at runtime due to missing function
  dependencies and function definition order issues.

# Quality Review: src/export/deliveryHandlers.js - Delivery Wizard Handlers

  ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Missing Error Type Import (Line 72)

  Problem: Code references ValidationError but this class is not imported or defined in this
  file. This will cause a runtime error.

  Issue 2: Missing Function Dependencies

  Problems: The following functions are called but not defined:
  - Line 76: getTasksByExportStatus()
  - Line 86: getStagingConfiguration()
  - Line 95: findStagingBatchFolder()
  - Line 114: previewDeliveryStructure() (not defined anywhere in file)

  Issue 3: Logic Error in File Count Calculation (Line 110)

  Problem: The code subtracts 1 from staged count assuming "export sheet that stays
  internal", but export sheets are separate files, not part of the task folder file count.
  This creates incorrect estimates.

  Issue 4: Unsafe Array Access (Line 131)

  Problem: stagedTasks[0]?.exportTime uses optional chaining but if stagedTasks is empty,
  this will still work. However, the code already checks for empty arrays at line 78, so this
   is redundant defensive coding that suggests uncertainty about data flow.

  Issue 5: Function Call Order Dependency

  Problem: Line 114 calls previewDeliveryStructure() with stagedTasks.slice(0, 5) but this
  function is not defined in the file. If it's in another file, there's no guarantee of load
  order.

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail at runtime due to missing ValidationError import and
  undefined function calls.

# Quality Review: src/export/status.js - Status Management Functions

  ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Missing Error Type Import (Line 105)

  Problem: Code references ValidationError but this class is not imported or defined in this
  file. This will cause a runtime error.

  Issue 2: Missing Function Dependencies

  Problems: The following functions are called but not defined:
  - Line 37: batchUpdateTasksOptimized() - not defined in this file
  - Line 60: getTasksSheet() - appears to be from schema.js
  - Line 67: getColumnIndex() - appears to be from schema.js
  - Line 87: formatTaskResponse() - not defined anywhere visible
  - Line 119: updateTaskRecord() - not defined in this file

  Issue 3: Invalid Status Handling (Line 113)

  Problem: The code checks for EXPORT_STATUS_VALUES.NULL but the schema defines this as null,
   not a string 'NULL'. This comparison will fail.

  Issue 4: Data Type Inconsistency (Lines 114-116)

  Problem: Setting fields to empty strings ('') when the schema expects specific data types:
  - exportBatchId should probably be null, not ''
  - stagedCount should be null or 0, not ''
  - exportTime should be null, not ''

  This could cause data validation issues.

  Issue 5: Inefficient Data Access Pattern (Lines 146+)

  Problem: The function loads all task data using getRange() when it only needs specific
  columns for status summary. This wastes memory and API quota.

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail at runtime due to missing ValidationError import and
  incorrect null value handling.

#  Quality Review: src/export/recovery.js - Recovery Functions

  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Missing Error Type Import (Line 117)

  Problem: Code references ValidationError but this class is not imported or defined in this
  file. This will cause a runtime error.

  Issue 2: Function Definition Mismatch (Line 58)

  Problem: Line 58 calls processTasksForStaging(stagingTasks, batchFolder.id, exportBatchId)
  but batchFolder is undefined at this point. The code searches for batchFolder at line 47,
  but if not found, creates newBatchFolder at line 50. The variable names don't match.

  Issue 3: Missing Function Dependencies

  Problems: The following functions are called but not defined:
  - Line 24: getTasksByExportStatus()
  - Line 41: getStagingConfiguration()
  - Line 47: findStagingBatchFolder()
  - Line 50: createStagingBatchFolder()
  - Line 58: processTasksForStaging()
  - Line 138: updateTaskExportStatus()
  - Line 145: resumeFailedStaging() (recursive call - could be infinite loop)

  Issue 4: Infinite Recursion Risk (Line 145)

  Problem: retryFailedStagingTasks() calls resumeFailedStaging() which could potentially call
   back to retry functions, creating an infinite loop if not carefully managed.

  Issue 5: Transaction Inconsistency (Lines 137-145)

  Problem: Tasks are reset to STAGING status (line 140) but if the retry fails, they remain
  in STAGING state instead of reverting to STAGING_FAILED. No rollback mechanism.

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail immediately at runtime due to missing ValidationError
  import and undefined variable references.

# Quality Review: src/export/filters.js - Enhanced Filtering Logic

  ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Missing Function Dependencies

  Problems:
  - Line 31: getUniqueColumnValues() - not defined in this file
  - Line 42: queryTasks() - not defined in this file
  - Line 151: getTasksForExport() - appears to be from queries.js

  Issue 2: Redundant Filtering Logic (Lines 150-168)

  Problem: The applyExportFilters() function re-applies filters that should already be
  handled by getTasksForExport(). Lines 154-166 duplicate filtering logic that's already
  implemented in the queries.js file, creating potential for inconsistent behavior.

  Issue 3: Missing Error Validation (Lines 112-118)

  Problem: The code converts input values to parseFloat() but doesn't validate that the
  conversion succeeded. Invalid input could result in NaN values being passed to the
  filtering logic.

  Issue 4: Incomplete Implementation

  Problem: Lines 135-140 define includeFiles filters but there's no logic that actually uses
  these file type filters anywhere in the codebase. This is dead code.

  Issue 5: Type Safety Issue (Line 42)

  Problem: The code calls queryTasks({ limit: 10000 }) without checking if queryTasks()
  supports a limit parameter or what happens if the system has more than 10,000 tasks.

  Functionality Assessment: Will work partially but has redundant logic and missing function
  dependencies that could cause runtime errors.

# Quality Review: src/export/reporting.js - System Reporting Functions

  CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:

  Issue 1: Massive Function Dependency Chain

  Problems: The following functions are called but not defined in this file:
  - Line 63: getRecoveryStatus()
  - Line 65: calculateHealthScore()
  - Line 66: getHealthStatus()
  - Line 71: getExportStatusSummary()
  - Line 88: getExportBatchHistory() (defined later, but called before)
  - Line 92: getStagingInformation()
  - Line 96: getPerformanceMetrics()
  - Line 100: getRecentActivity()
  - Line 104: generateRecommendations()
  - Line 145: queryTasks()

  This creates a massive dependency web that's likely to fail.

  Issue 2: Inconsistent Return Format (Lines 117-120)

  Problem: This function returns {success: true, report: report} which matches the expected
  format in menu.js line 313, but this creates an inconsistent pattern where some functions
  return data directly and others wrap it in a success object.

  Issue 3: Complex Object Access Without Validation (Lines 75-82)

  Problem: The code performs deep object property access without null checks:
  taskSummary.activeBatches ? Object.keys(taskSummary.activeBatches).reduce(...)
  If taskSummary.activeBatches has unexpected structure, this will fail.

  Issue 4: Performance Issues (Line 145)

  Problem: The function queries ALL tasks (queryTasks({ limit: 10000 })) just to get export
  batch information. This is extremely inefficient and will hit Google Apps Script quotas
  quickly.

  Issue 5: Type Inconsistency (Line 142)

  Problem: The function getExportBatchHistory(limit = 50) accepts a limit parameter but
  completely ignores it, always querying 10,000 tasks instead.

  Functionality Assessment: Will fail at runtime due to missing function dependencies and
  likely hit performance/quota limits due to inefficient queries.
